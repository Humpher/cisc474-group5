    Welcome to Newark’s own Computer Science Maximum Security Prison. You were wrongfully accused of copying code for 
    your CISC220 red-black tree project and were thrown in here without a fair trial. By University of Delaware law, the punishment 
    for such a crime is death by electric chair! You must try and find your way out before it’s too late to redeem yourself!
    
    How to Play:
    
            The objective of the game is to escape the room using your wit, and objects you may collect or interact with along the way. 
        There will be no indication by a cursor change when you can interact with an object just to make the game a little less obvious. 
        The arrow buttons on the bottom middle of the game screen is how you change the angle you are looking at the room. Once the timer 
        runs out the game will end and you will get a game over! There are also two more game elements that will be explained more below.
    
    Inventory
    
    Accessible through a button which is displayed with a chest on the bottom left of your game screen, click it to open and close the inventory
    Items you collect along the way will appear here and will vanish when used
    To use an item, you will need to click on the item you wish to use, and then interact with the game screen object you wish to use it on
    
    Zoom Feature
    
    The magnifying glass button is located next to the inventory
    This button will only activate and deactivate the zoom feature
    
    Good Luck!
